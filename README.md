# **Node.js Dependency Compatibility Test**

This test checks your ability to fix **broken or outdated dependencies** in a Node.js project. The project you receive will contain version conflicts and missing or incorrect packages. Your job is to make it run.

---

## **What You Need to Do**

### **1. Find the Problems**

Look through the project and identify:

* Outdated or incompatible versions
* Missing or duplicated dependencies
* Configuration mistakes

---

### **2. Fix the Dependencies**

Update the dependency file so the project:

* Installs without errors
* Runs cleanly
* Uses compatible versions

---

### **3. Show That It Works**

After fixing everything:

* Provide a **short script** that proves the project runs
  (e.g., start a small server, run a simple build, deploy a basic module, or make a minimal Web3/API call)

---

## **What to Submit**

1. **Your fixed `package.json` file**
2. **A small codebase** (only the files needed to run your test)
3. **Your test script** that confirms everything works

---

## **Goal**

Show that you can quickly:

* Spot dependency issues
* Fix version conflicts
* Make a broken Node.js project work again
